1. Add a link somewhere in your app to /admin/users for admins to access the
	 list of users.

2. Any other admin controllers should inherit from Admin::AdminController.

   to access the admin controllers.

3. Manually set an 'admin' role on at least one user, or you won't be able
   to access the admin area.
